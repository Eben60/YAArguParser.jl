# Preface

This package is a fork of [`SimpleArgParse`](https://github.com/admercs/SimpleArgParse.jl), which in turn is a minimalistic command-line argument parsing library in the spirit of Python's [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html). 

The code has been substantially refactored, the parser made extensible, and interactive use in console applications and an extensible input validator has been added. See [New Features and Changelog](@ref) for details.
